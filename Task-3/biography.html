        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I’m <strong>Hannah Faye P. Bayno</strong>, a freshman at the University of Mindanao, pursuing a Bachelor’s Degree in <strong>Computer Science</strong>. 
            I am passionate about technology and driven by a desire to become a successful Software Engineer. I have a bit of a reserved 
            personality but I can adapt to different situations and places. I am very eager to learn more about the things my course has 
            to offer. An interesting fact about me is that I actually own and manage a small business on the side; a crochet business 
            which is totally unrelated to my course but I believe it has equipped me with the essential skills I need for project 
            management, communication, and customer service. I learned to be patient, detailed, 
            and professional in dealing with problems that may arise which can prove useful professionally and in daily life.</p>
